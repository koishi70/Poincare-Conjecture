# Poincaré Ch. 1 — the broken chart variation of a geodesic: the data package

This file **constructs** the broken chart variation that half 2 of
`prop:minimal-geodesic-no-conjugate` (*a minimizing geodesic has nonnegative index form*)
computes with.  Every analytic ingredient already existed; what was missing was the
construction itself, and that is what `exists_brokenVariationData` supplies.

## The input

A geodesic `γ` on `[a, b] ⊇ [0, 1]` (with room at both ends), a parallel frame `e` along
it, and a test field given by its **frame coefficients**, split at a corner `c ∈ (0, 1)`
into two globally-`C³` halves `W₀`, `W₁` with `W₀ c = W₁ c`.  This is *exactly* the output
of `exists_indexForm_neg_smooth_of_isConjugatePointAt` (`Ch01/IndexFormNegativeSmooth.lean`),
so the interface is demonstrably not vacuous.

The manifold field is the lift of the glued coefficient curve,
`V = frameFieldOf g γ e (glueCoeff c W₀ W₁)`, and the field *of the `i`-th piece* is the
lift of the **smooth half** that owns that piece,
`frameFieldOf g γ e (if i < k then W₀ else W₁)`.

## The construction

1. **Partition through the corner.**  `exists_chart_partition_slack_through` partitions
   `[0, 1]` with `τ k = c`, chart centres `β i`, and a slack `r > 0` such that `γ` carries
   the enlarged *open* interval `Ioo (τ i - r) (τ (i+1) + r)` into `(chartAt H (β i)).source`.
   Routing the partition through `c` is what makes the field have **no corner inside any
   piece**: on the `i`-th piece the glued field agrees with the globally smooth half
   `if i < k then W₀ else W₁` (`glueCoeff_eq_half_on_piece`).

2. **Chart readings.**  On the enlarged piece, the chart reading `ŷᵢ = φ_{β i} ∘ γ` of the
   geodesic is `C³` (`contDiffOn_chartReading_of_isGeodesicOn`), and the chart reading
   `Ŷᵢ = chartVectorRep γ (β i) Vᵢ` of the piece field is `C³` — it expands in the frame as
   `∑ⱼ ⟪𝔟 ⱼ, W(s)⟫ • chartVectorRep γ (β i) (e j) s` (`chartVectorRep_frameLift_eq`), whose
   frame factors are `C³` by the parallel-transport bootstrap
   (`contDiffOn_chartVectorRep_of_isParallelAlongOn`).

3. **Junction curves.**  `cᵢ = globalGeodesic g hg (γ (τ i)) (V (τ i))` — a genuine manifold
   geodesic with prescribed initial data; its chart reading in the chart at `β i` is `C³`
   near `σ = 0` (`contDiffOn_chartReading_globalGeodesic`), with derivative
   `chartVectorRep γ (β i) V (τ i)` at `σ = 0`.

4. **Bump-extension and assembly.**  All four one-variable data are bump-extended to
   globally-`C³` functions agreeing with them on **open** sets
   (`exists_contDiff_eqOn_of_contDiffOn_Ioo`), and fed to `chartVariation`
   (`Ch01/ChartVariation.lean`).  The tube lemma
   (`exists_forall_mem_of_isCompact_of_continuous`) over the *compact* enlarged piece then
   confines the whole family to the chart target for small variation parameters, and the
   finitely many per-piece radii are minimized over `Finset.range N`.

## What is delivered

* `exists_brokenVariationData` — **the data package**, an existence statement, hence not
  vacuous: the chart families `u i`, their `C³` regularity, their confinement to the chart
  targets on an enlarged box, the identification of the `s = 0` line with `γ`, of the two
  junction curves with the prescribed global geodesics (and of their stay in the chart
  source, so that those readings may be read *back* into `M`), and of the `∂_s`-field with
  the chart reading of the piece field.  Every clause is proved.

* `hasDerivAt_deriv_pieceEnergy_indexIntegrand` — **the second variation of one piece IS the
  abstract index form of its coefficients**:

    `d²/ds² Eᵢ(0) = indexForm (frameCurvOp g γ e) (τ i) (τ (i+1)) W (W′) W (W′)`,

  with `W` the smooth half owning the piece.  Its hypotheses are, one for one, the clauses
  of the data package (the two junction hypotheses being routed through
  `covDerivAlong_fst_eq_zero_of_globalGeodesic_junction`), so it is directly composable
  with it.

* `hasDerivAt_pieceEnergy_chartMetricBilin` — the first `s`-derivative of a piece energy on a
  whole neighbourhood of `0`, which is what lets `deriv_deriv_sum_eq` split the *second*
  derivative of the total energy across the pieces.

* `isMetricCompatibleAt_chartMetricBilin_target` — the honest domain of the chart data is the
  whole chart target (the tangent-bundle trivialization's base set at `α` *is* the chart
  source at `α`), which is what makes the box clause of the data package the right one.

## What this feeds

`Ch01/MinimalGeodesicNoConjugate.lean` consumes the data package and closes half 2:
`s = 0` is a *local minimum* of the total energy `𝓔 (s) = ∑ᵢ Eᵢ(s)` (because `γ` is
minimizing and the endpoints of the varied curve are fixed by `globalGeodesic_zero_velocity`,
the outer junction curves having zero initial velocity), hence
`0 ≤ deriv (deriv 𝓔) 0 = ∑ᵢ Iᵢ`, hence `indexForm ≥ 0`.

A note for readers of the history: an earlier draft of this file reported the `∀ s` in the
junction hypothesis of `sq_dist_le_sum_chartFamily_energy` as a genuine obstruction, and
proposed a reparametrization clamp to work around it.  That was a misdiagnosis of an
*over-strong hypothesis*, not a real wall: every use of `hjunc` inside
`Ch01/BrokenVariationGlue.lean` was already at the single `s` in play, so the `∀ s` was pure
surplus and has been removed.  With the single-`s` form, the junction matching follows
directly from the eventual junction clauses below (intersect the finitely many
neighbourhoods with `Filter.eventually_all_finset`).  No clamp is needed.

chart partition is routed through `c`. -/

`[τ i, τ (i+1)]` the glued coefficient curve coincides with `W₀` when `i < k` and with `W₁`
when `k ≤ i`.

The only delicate point is the piece that *ends* at the corner (`i + 1 = k`) and the one
that *starts* there (`i = k`): at the single time `s = c` both halves are used, and they
agree there by `hmatch`. -/

/-- **Math.** **The broken chart variation of a minimizing geodesic: the data.**

Let `γ` be a geodesic on `[a, b] ⊇ [0, 1]` (`a < 0 < 1 < b`), `e` a parallel frame along it,
and let a test field be given by its frame coefficients, split at a corner `c ∈ (0, 1)` into
two halves `W₀` (of class `C³` on `(a, b)`) and `W₁` (of class `C³` on `ℝ`) matching at `c`.
Write `V = frameFieldOf g γ e (glueCoeff c W₀ W₁)` for the resulting field along `γ`.

Then there exist a partition `0 = τ 0 < ⋯ < τ N = 1` **through the corner** (`τ k = c`,
`0 < k < N`), chart centres `β i`, chart families `u i : ℝ × ℝ → E`, and radii `ρ, ε > 0`
with `ε ≤ ρ`, such that:

* each `u i` is `C³` on the whole parameter plane;
* `u i` maps the enlarged box `(-ε, ε) × (τ i - ρ, τ (i+1) + ρ)` into the chart target — so
  every consumer that reads `u i` back into `M` through the chart at `β i` is legitimate;
* the unvaried line `s = 0` of `u i` **is** `γ` read in the chart at `β i`, on a
  neighbourhood of every time of the `i`-th closed piece;
* the two junction curves `σ ↦ u i (σ, τ i)` and `σ ↦ u i (σ, τ (i+1))` **are** the global
  geodesics with initial data `(γ (τ j), V (τ j))`, read in the chart at `β i`, for `σ` near
  `0` — this is what makes the assembled broken path a genuine curve *and* kills each piece's
  second-variation boundary term inside its own chart;
* the `∂_s`-field of `u i` on the unvaried line is the chart reading of the **piece field**
  `frameFieldOf g γ e (if i < k then W₀ else W₁)` — the globally smooth half that owns the
  piece, which on the piece agrees with `V` (`glueCoeff_eq_half_on_piece`);
* `γ` stays in the `i`-th chart source over the enlarged piece.

**Note on the `∂_s` clause.** It is stated with the *piece* field, not with the glued field
`V`.  This is forced, and is not a weakening in practice: the clause is an *eventual* identity
on a neighbourhood of each `t` of the piece, and at `t = c` any neighbourhood straddles the
corner, where `V` switches halves while `u (k-1)` — a `C³` object — cannot.  On the piece
itself the two fields agree, which is all a consumer needs (`glueCoeff_eq_half_on_piece`, and
`frameVec_frameLift_apply` turns the piece field's frame coordinates back into `W₀`/`W₁`).

/-! ### The second variation of one piece, as the abstract index form of the coefficients -/

/-- **Math.** **The genuine chart data is metric-compatible on the whole chart target.**
`isMetricCompatibleAt_chartMetricBilin` (`Ch01/ChartMetricCompatible.lean`) asks for two
things: the chart point in the *interior* of the chart target (which, the model being
boundaryless, is the target itself), and its readback in the trivialization base set — but
the base set of the tangent-bundle trivialization at `α` **is** the chart source at `α`

/-- **Math.** **The second variation of one piece of the broken variation IS the index form
of the piece's frame coefficients.**

Let `γ` be a geodesic on `[a, b]` with a parallel `g`-orthonormal frame `e`, let
`[τ₀ - ρ, τ₁ + ρ] ⊆ [a, b]` be an enlarged piece whose `γ`-image lies in the chart at `α`,
and let `u` be a `C³` chart family satisfying exactly the clauses that
`exists_brokenVariationData` produces:

* `u` maps the enlarged box into the chart target (`hbox`);
* the `s = 0` line reads `γ` in the chart near every time of the piece (`hline`);
* its `∂_s`-field reads the frame-coefficient field `W` (`hvar`);
* the two junction curves are geodesics in the chart (`hj₀`, `hj₁` — discharge these with
  `covDerivAlong_fst_eq_zero_of_globalGeodesic_junction` from the junction clauses of the
  data package).

Then the energy of this piece is twice differentiable at `s = 0` and

`d²/ds² Eᵢ(0) = ∫_{τ₀}^{τ₁} (⟪W′, W′⟫ − ⟪ℛ(t) W, W⟫) dt = I_{[τ₀,τ₁]}(W, W)`,

the **abstract index form** of the coefficient curve `W` in which half 1 of
`prop:minimal-geodesic-no-conjugate` (`exists_indexForm_neg_smooth_of_isConjugatePointAt`)
delivers its strictly negative direction.

The two seams doing the translation are `chartIndexIntegrand_eq_indexIntegrand_frameVec`
(chart integrand `=` abstract integrand of the frame coordinates) and
`frameVec_frameLift_apply` (the frame coordinates of the lift of `W` are `W` again), with
the covariant-derivative hypothesis discharged by
`covariantDerivCoord_chartVectorRep_frameLift` — in a *parallel* frame the covariant
derivative of the lift is the coordinate derivative of the coefficients.

`claim:second-variation-minimal-geodesic`. -/

/-- **Math.** **The first `s`-derivative of one piece's energy, on a whole neighbourhood of
`0`.**  The companion of `hasDerivAt_deriv_pieceEnergy_indexIntegrand`: `deriv` of a finite
sum only splits where *every* summand is differentiable, and — for the *second* derivative of
the sum — that has to hold on a whole neighbourhood of `0`, not just at `0`.  This is
`hasDerivAt_pieceEnergy` (`Ch01/PieceEnergyDeriv.lean`) with the abstract metric `G`
instantiated at the genuine chart Gram data, whose `C²` regularity on the chart target is
`contDiffOn_chartMetricBilin`.

Together with `hasDerivAt_deriv_pieceEnergy_indexIntegrand` these are exactly the two
hypotheses `hd`, `hd2` of `deriv_deriv_sum_eq`. -/
